## üßÆ Mathematical Background

### Naive Bayes Theorem

The classifier applies Bayes' theorem for classification:

```
P(spam|features) = P(features|spam) √ó P(spam) / P(features)
```

Where:
- `P(spam|features)`: Posterior probability of spam given features
- `P(features|spam)`: Likelihood of features given spam class
- `P(spam)`: Prior probability of spam class
- `P(features)`: Evidence (normalizing constant)

### Independence Assumption

Naive Bayes assumes **conditional independence** between features:

```
P(f1,f2,...,fn|class) = P(f1|class) √ó P(f2|class) √ó ... √ó P(fn|class)
```

This project includes analysis of when this assumption holds and its impact on classification accuracy.

### Feature Engineering

Key features for classification:
- **Numerical**: `Spam Score` (continuous values 0-156)
- **Categorical**: `Status` (Archived, Bounced, Held, etc.)
- **Text**: `Subject` and `From` fields (word patterns, domains)
- **Derived**: Email domain reputation, subject keyword frequency
